    description: CNN analyzed data from four of the few metropolitan police
      departments that publish data about the gender of the officers involved in
      use of force incidents. In all four cities, female officers were involved
      in a smaller percentage of incidents than their share of the department.
      Texas cities were not studied, but the findings are consistent with TJI's
      previous findings.
