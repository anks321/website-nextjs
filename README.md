## Using Next JS

To create a new page, simply create a new js file in [/pages](./pages). You can use this [template](./pages/_template-page.js) as a starter or create your own React Stateless or Class Component.

There is also an [example page](./pages/example-page.js) that has some examples of using Styled Components and where we can add other heavily commented examples in the future.
