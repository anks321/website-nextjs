# TJI Next JS Website

This is a basic starter. To get started clone this repo and cd to the directory, then run:

`yarn`

To start the dev server run:

`yarn dev`

Alternatively, you can use npm with `npm install` and `npm run dev` but that's two extra words you have to type and who needs that?

The url for the dev server will be: http://localhost:3333/

## Using Next JS

To create a new page, simply create a new js file in [/pages](./pages). You can use this [template](./pages/_template-page.js) as a starter or create your own React Stateless or Class Component.

There is also an [example page](./pages/example-page.js) that has some examples of using Styled Components and where we can add other heavily commented examples in the future.
